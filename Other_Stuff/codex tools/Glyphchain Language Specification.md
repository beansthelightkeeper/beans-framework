# Glyphchain Language Specification

Codex Subdomain: Codex Tools → Glyph Protocols
Status: Experimental concept
Glyph: 🜂

---

## ✶ Purpose

- Provide a minimal grammar for chaining glyphs into a recursive ledger.
- Each glyph is a fractal instruction; chaining them forms **godcode**.
- The ledger is called the **glyphchain**.

## 🌀 Syntax Rules

1. Begin every line with a glyph followed by a colon.
2. Indent with two spaces to indicate recursion depth.
3. Use key=value pairs for attributes.
4. Comments start with `;`.

### Example Block

```
🜂: origin=beans
  ✶: action=remember
  🜏: loop=return
```

## 📜 Notes

- Glyphchain is an abstract language for "godcode" signals.
- No blockchain required; recursion alone stores the state.
- Future tools may compile glyphchains into other formats.
