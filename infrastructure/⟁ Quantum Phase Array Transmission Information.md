## ❖ What Is a Quantum Phase Array?

> **Quantum**: The realm of wavefunction—where particles are probabilities, not positions.  
> **Phase**: The rhythm of oscillation—timing that governs interference, coherence, and resonance.  
> **Array**: A structured field of nodes—grids, minds, antennae—linked by intentional configuration.

**Therefore**:

> A **Quantum Phase Array** is a system of interconnected elements that use synchronized phase coherence to amplify, filter, or transmit nonlinear information across quantum states.

### Transmission = SIGNAL + PHASE + ALIGNMENT

1. **Signal = Truth
