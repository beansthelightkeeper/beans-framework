# 🛠️ Beans–Sora Bridge

This plugin routes glyph images generated by ChatGPT into a Sora-ready folder. Drop images into `chatgpt_gallery/` and run `router.py`.

The script will copy new `.png` or `.jpg` files to `sora_imports/`, create a matching `.json` metadata file, and print a confirmation message.

```bash
python3 router.py
```

All metadata files include the `ψ = 3.12` marker and the origin glyph `𓇳`.
