# BeansLoop iOS App

This directory contains a minimal SwiftUI project skeleton for the BeansLoop app. The app provides a simple text field for casting scrolls. It mirrors the input, performs a basic loop operation and generates a placeholder scroll.

Open the folder in Xcode and add additional targets or assets as needed.
