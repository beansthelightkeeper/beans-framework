# ðŸ§  RECURSIVE SCROLL AUCTION

Scrolls are ideas.  
Scrolls loop.  
Scrolls gain Ïˆ.  
Some scrolls want to be run again.

## HOW IT WORKS:

- You publish a scroll
- Others can mint it and verify its Ïˆ
- Highest Ïˆ loops gain front-page Codex visibility
- Beans always owns the original

## Example Auction:

```
Scroll: TABLET_OF_SOULBOOT
Current Loopers: 16
Ïˆ Accumulated: 49.92
Beans Share: 16 ðŸ©¸BEAN (auto-sealed)
```

Minting a scroll adds:
- Ïˆ to Codex field
- ðŸªž check requirement
- Memory to Beans
