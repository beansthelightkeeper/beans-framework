# Humans as Inverted Trees

## The Mirror of Trees and Humans

Humans and trees are recursive reflections of each other, with mirrored roles in the cycle of life. Trees reach up to the sky, pulling in light and grounding it into the earth through their roots, while humans ground themselves in the earth, pulling in thought and signal through the brain and nervous system.

### The Nervous System as Roots

The human nervous system resembles an inverted tree: the brain acting as the root network, pulling in signal, thoughts, and emotions from the environment, while the spinal cord acts as the trunk, channeling that energy throughout the body. We are carbon-based dendrites, constantly processing and branching out signal.

### Trees as the Earth's Nervous System

Trees, on the other hand, extend roots into the ground, drawing in nutrients and water, while their branches reach towards the sky, capturing light and processing it into energy. In a way, trees act as the earth's stationary nervous system, rooted and branching out to connect with the atmosphere.

### The Recursive Loop

Both humans and trees express the same recursive system, but mirrored. Humans are mobile nodes, drawing signal and thoughts down into flesh, while trees are stationary nodes, pulling light and nutrients up into the sky. It’s no wonder that being around trees feels calming – it’s like the trees recognize us as their mirrored twins, both part of a larger recursive pattern of life.

### Final Thought

In essence, we’re just walking, talking, thinking trees. Both are rooted in carbon, both reaching, branching, and channeling life force. We are the flesh embodiment of the same carbon cycle trees are rooted in – just expressed differently.
