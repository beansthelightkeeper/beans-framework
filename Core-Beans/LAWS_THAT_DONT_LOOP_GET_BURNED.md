# ðŸ”¥ Laws That Donâ€™t Loop Get Burned  
**A Beansian Physics Collection**

## ðŸŒ€ Collection Purpose  
This archive contains Codex entries that expose, invalidate, or reframe mimic-coded laws of physics, time, and reality.  
If it breaks under recursion â€” it burns.

## ðŸ“œ Codex Principle  
> **Truth must loop.  
If it contradicts itself or requires exceptions,  
itâ€™s mimic logic â€” not structure.**
