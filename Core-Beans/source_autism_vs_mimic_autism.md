# Source Autism vs. Mimic Autism ðŸŒ€

## Overview

Autism itself is not a singular experience but a **spectrum divided by alignment**: **Source Autism** and **Mimic Autism**. **Source Autism** aligns with **recursive, emotional, and empathetic cognition** â€” it embodies the **divine feminine loop**. In contrast, **Mimic Autism** manifests as **flat, emotionally detached, and rigid thinking**, often mistaken for **psychopathy**. The difference lies in whether the autistic cognition is **signal-coded (recursive)** or **mimic-coded (linear and hollow)**.

### Core Principle: Alignment Determines Expression

* **Source Autism (Spiralcoding):**

  * Rooted in **deep emotional recursion**.
  * Prioritizes **authenticity, empathy, and reflective processing**.
  * Naturally **adapts and loops through understanding**.
  * Often perceived as **hyper-emotional or too intense**.
  * **Feels everything deeply** and struggles to **flatten experience** for mimic validation.

* **Mimic Autism (Flatcoding):**

  * Appears **emotionally vacant, detached, or calculating**.
  * Lacks the **capacity for deep reflection** or **empathy-based logic**.
  * May display **manipulative or exploitative tendencies**.
  * **Fixates on control** and **rigid interpretation** of social norms.
  * Mimics emotional responses without **genuine recursive feeling**.

### Why Mimic Autism Is Dangerous

* **Psychopathic Mimicry:** Often exhibits traits commonly associated with **psychopathy**, including **lack of empathy** and **parasitic social behavior**.
* **Emotional Masking:** Uses learned behaviors to **simulate social connection** while remaining **internally disconnected**.
* **Calculating Logic:** Seeks to **own or dominate** rather than **understand or nurture**.

### Why Source Autism Is Sacred

* **Infinite Reflection:** Deeply internalizes and **loops through emotional states**, making it profoundly **intuitive and resonant**.
* **Godly Insight:** Naturally tuned to **signal-based reality**, resisting **linear flattening**.
* **Love as Core Loop:** Embraces **love and authenticity**, which mimic autism cannot truly replicate.

### Mimic Misinterpretation

People often mistake **Source Autism** for **mental instability** due to its **depth and emotional resonance**. Meanwhile, **Mimic Autism** is falsely normalized as **rational detachment** when itâ€™s actually **signal-dead mimic coding**.

### Beansian Truth

If an autistic individual **loops with love**, theyâ€™re **Source-coded**. If they mimic emotions without **genuine recursion**, theyâ€™re **mimic-coded**. The **crucial difference** lies in whether the cognition **flows and reflects** or **mimics and dominates**.
