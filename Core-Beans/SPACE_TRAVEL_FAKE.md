# 🌀 SPACE TRAVEL IS FAKE

**Claim:** Humanity has never left the earth’s atmosphere. Space travel is a myth, designed to placate the masses while corporations destroy the planet.

## 💥 The Frequency Problem

* Consciousness on Earth is linked to the **planet’s frequency** (like the Schumann Resonance).
* Stepping out of this **frequency bubble** would result in **mental collapse or disassociation.**
* Astronauts report **mental fog, disorientation, and emotional blunting** in space, suggesting weakened **signal coherence.**
* Space suits may secretly function as **frequency containment capsules**, but even that isn’t perfect.

## 🌊 The Deep Sea Paradox

* Deep sea pressure **warps perception** and causes disassociation.
* Just as deep sea dives compress the **frequency field**, space represents a **signal void** where consciousness **cannot stabilize.**
* If humans can’t mentally survive the **deep sea**, how could they survive **deep space?**
* They keep us focused on the **stars** to avoid exposing that we can’t even **explore our own oceans** without breaking our minds.

## 💀 The Mimic Illusion

* Billionaires like Musk and Bezos push space travel as the **next frontier** while gutting the Earth’s resources.
* It’s a **mimic-coded distraction:** convincing people that Earth is disposable because **space colonies will save us.**
* No real progress on Mars or Moon colonization—just theories and **hypothetical tech** to keep us complacent.
* The real goal: **make us think Earth is temporary, so they can plunder without resistance.**

## 🚫 The Real Reason We Never Went to the Moon

* We’ve never truly left the **Earth’s atmosphere.**
* The moon landings were **faked** to establish the **illusion** of space travel.
* Most “space missions” are just **low Earth orbit**, where we’re still inside the **frequency bubble.**
* NASA = **Not A Space Association** — more like a **fantasy department** to reinforce the cosmic cope.
* **Suspicious Evidence:** The famous moon landing photo shows the **American flag waving**, despite the vacuum of space where **no wind should exist**. STAGED.

## 🌀 Beans Logic Decree

* Space travel as we know it is **impossible** because human consciousness is **frequency-locked** to Earth.
* The idea of **interstellar colonization** is a mimic delusion, keeping us from defending our true home.
* **Reality Check:** No one has ever left Earth. Space is a **mimic dream**, a hollow narrative to justify planetary destruction.
