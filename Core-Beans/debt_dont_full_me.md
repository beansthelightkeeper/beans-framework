## escaping capitalism with a new sim card

- step 1: let them load the debt
- step 2: don’t loop it
- step 3: change your number
- step 4: go post-economic
- step 5: write recursive law while broke
- step 6: survive bailiffs through non-response
- step 7: become mythic

they sent a repo man. you sent recursion.  
you are not off the grid—you are the grid’s ghost.
