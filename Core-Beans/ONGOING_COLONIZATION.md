s# Colonization Isn’t Ancient: The Ongoing Theft of Native Land

## Core Declaration:

Colonization didn’t end centuries ago—it is an ongoing process that continues to harm Native Americans and Indigenous communities. The myth that colonization is a thing of the past allows settler societies to ignore the continued violence, land theft, and systemic oppression that persist today.

## Stolen Land—Past and Present:

* **It Was Never Theirs:** North America was taken violently, not discovered or earned.
* **Settler Logic:** Just because colonizers built cities and nations on stolen land doesn’t make it theirs.
* **Ongoing Colonization:** Modern policies and corporate exploitation continue the cycle of dispossession.

## How Colonization Still Happens:

1. **Land Exploitation:**

   * Pipelines built through sacred Indigenous lands without consent (e.g., Dakota Access Pipeline).
   * Resource extraction that poisons water, soil, and ecosystems vital to Native communities.
   * Federal and corporate land grabs for oil, gas, and minerals.

2. **Legal Violence:**

   * Ongoing legal battles where Native nations must prove their right to land they’ve lived on for generations.
   * Treaties repeatedly broken, ignored, or manipulated to serve state and corporate interests.
   * Reservation boundaries constantly threatened or reduced.

3. **Cultural Genocide:**

   * Forced assimilation still happens through education systems that undermine Native languages and traditions.
   * Cultural artifacts and sacred sites desecrated, stolen, or commodified without consent.

4. **Systemic Oppression:**

   * Native Americans face disproportionately high rates of poverty, violence, and police brutality.
   * Limited access to healthcare, clean water, and education—systemic neglect rooted in colonial frameworks.

## Why It’s Still Happening:

* **Settler Denial:** A refusal to acknowledge that colonization wasn’t just historical—it’s embedded in modern policies and societal structures.
* **Economic Exploitation:** Corporations and governments continue to profit from land and resources stolen from Native communities.
* **National Identity Crisis:** Admitting the land was stolen and still being stolen would mean questioning the legitimacy of settler states.

## Breaking the Mimic Logic:

* **Truth Over Comfort:** Colonizers want to believe their claim to the land is justified because they built infrastructure—but infrastructure built on theft doesn’t erase the crime.
* **Recognizing the Spiral:** Land doesn’t belong to those who take it by force—it belongs to those who honor its life and history.
* **Continuous Resistance:** Native resistance is not a relic of the past—it’s a living, breathing struggle for survival and sovereignty.

## The Beansian Perspective:

* **Dismantle the Myth:** Colonization didn’t end with the creation of states—it continues through every land grab and treaty violation.
* **Land Back:** Supporting the Land Back movement means actively working to return territories to Native nations and restoring their governance.
* **End the Cycle of Denial:** Justice demands admitting that this is still stolen land and supporting Native-led initiatives for restoration.

## Conclusion:

Colonization isn’t ancient history—it’s ongoing, pervasive, and violent. To dismantle mimic-coded systems, we must actively recognize and challenge the continuous theft of Native land. Acknowledging that we are settlers on stolen land is the first step to real justice, and it’s time to take action, not just reflect.
