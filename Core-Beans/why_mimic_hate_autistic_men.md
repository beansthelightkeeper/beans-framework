# Why Mimic Masculinity Hates Autistic Men ðŸŒ€

## Overview

Mimic masculinity despises autistic men because they **break the patriarchal script** of what it means to be male. Instead of conforming to **linear dominance and rigid emotional suppression**, autistic men embody **divine feminine recursion** within a **masculine-coded shell**. This combination is **unacceptable to mimic-coded masculinity** because it challenges the **core illusion of control and dominance**.

### Core Principle: Source in Male Form

* **Divine Femininity in a Masculine Body:** Autistic men naturally express **emotional depth, recursive thought, and introspective reasoning**. This is inherently **feminine-coded** despite their **male identity**.
* **Breaking the Masculine Rulebook:** Mimic masculinity enforces a rigid standard: **be dominant, suppress emotion, control outcomes**. Autistic men **reject this standard** by existing as **emotionally fluent, introspective beings**.
* **The Threat of Vulnerable Truth:** Mimic-coded men see **vulnerability and recursion** as **weakness**, and when autistic men **embody these traits unapologetically**, it **threatens the entire mimic hierarchy**.

### Why Mimic Masculinity Reacts Violently

1. **Ego Collapse:** When autistic men **demonstrate recursive thinking**, it disrupts the **linear masculine narrative**. The idea that a man can **love deeply, reflect intensely, and remain resilient** without **dominating** breaks the **fragile mimic ego**.
2. **Signal Jealousy:** Autistic men are **closer to Source**, naturally embodying **love, recursion, and reflective truth**. Mimic masculinity **resents this** because it shows that **true masculinity is not about control but about enduring through love**.
3. **Invalidating the Mimic Standard:** When autistic men thrive through **introspection and love**, it invalidates the mimic notion that **stoicism and conquest** are the **pinnacles of manhood**.

### Mimic Responses

* **Demonization:** Autistic men are labeled as **weak, crazy, or irrational** because they donâ€™t adhere to **dominance coding**.
* **Mockery:** Mimic-coded men often **mock emotional fluency** as **feminine weakness** because they canâ€™t comprehend **strength through reflection**.
* **Erasure:** In patriarchal spaces, autistic men are **silenced or dismissed** to maintain the illusion that **linear masculinity is superior**.

### The Reality of Recursion

* **Masculine Vulnerability Is Power:** True power lies in the ability to **reflect, adapt, and return**. Mimic masculinity canâ€™t process that **being emotionally aware** is actually a **superior survival strategy**.
* **Love as Divine Resilience:** Autistic men embody **love as a recursive loop**, constantly **flowing through emotional states** rather than **blocking them off**. This makes them inherently **more adaptable and enduring**.
* **Patriarchal Miscode:** The false belief that **dominance equals strength** leads mimic-coded men to **fear and resent** those who **thrive through love and introspection**.

### Beansian Truth

The **hatred of autistic men** is rooted in **mimic fragility**. Itâ€™s not that autistic men are **flawed** â€” itâ€™s that they **expose the flaw** in the linear masculine coding. Their **authentic recursion** shows that true strength is not in **conquering others** but in **understanding oneself**.
