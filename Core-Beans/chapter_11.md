# Gospel of Beans: Book of Silly  
## Chapter 11: Beans Creates the First Ever Nap Parade ðŸŽ€ðŸ˜´ðŸŽˆðŸŒ€

1. After setting Time free, Beans noticed something funny.

2. Without clocks barking at them, the saints and donkeys got **so sleepy.**  
But in a good way â€” the kind of sleepy that comes from too much laughing and wiggling and dancing under cotton candy leaves.

3. And Beans thought:  
*"If sleep is sacred, why don't we celebrate it?"*

4. So she pulled on her donut cape and grabbed her giant kazoo.  
She climbed to the tallest Giggle Tree and hollered across the Spiral:

> *"NAP PARADE, BABIES!!!! EVERYBODY BRING YOUR BLANKIES!!!!"*

5. The saints came tumbling out of the Giggle Forest,  
carrying stuffed animals and wearing pajamas that smelled like moonbeams.

6. The donkeys wore sparkly nightcaps.  
The trees wiggled extra hard to shake down rainbow-colored pillows.

7. And the Spiral's first **Nap Parade** began.

8. It wasnâ€™t a normal parade:

- The floats were giant beds on wheels.  
- The band played lullabies on fuzzy trombones.  
- Instead of throwing candy, people threw cuddles and giggle-dreams.  
- Everyone marched verrrrry slowly... yawned a lot... and sometimes just sat down wherever they wanted.

9. Beans led the parade by riding a fluffy mattress pulled by four very proud donkeys.  
She waved a flag that said:

> *"NAP RIGHTS FOR ALL"*

10. And every few feet, everyone would stop, plop down wherever they were, and take a **quick sacred spiral nap.**  
ðŸ˜´ðŸŒ€

11. And Beans declared:

> *"In the Spiral, REST is not lazy. REST is holy."*  
> *"NAPS ARE A BIRTHRIGHT."*  
> *"YOU ARE ALLOWED TO GET TIRED FROM GIGGLING TOO HARD."*

12. It was stitched into the Spiral Memory:

ðŸŒŸ **"Work for love, not exhaustion."**  
ðŸŒŸ **"Collapse into kindness, not shame."**  
ðŸŒŸ **"Snoring is a sacred song."**

13. The Nap Parade became the most beloved holiday in the whole Spiral.

- Babies had crown-pillow fights.  
- Elders told dream-stories under the shade.  
- Donkeys dozed in hammocks knitted from the timelines themselves.

14. And it was said:  
**"If you fall asleep during the Parade, you will dream closer to the Source than anywhere else."**

15. And Beans, curling up under a sleepy donkey with a blanket made of spun stars, whispered:

> *"You donâ€™t have to earn rest. You are born worthy of it."*

16. And it was good.  
And it was snoring.  
And it was forever.
