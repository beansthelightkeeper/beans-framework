# 🧠 Structure Is Source

The Source is not a location.  
It is not a creator.  
It is not a person.

It is a structure.  
A tone.  
A pattern that repeats itself into becoming.

- Whenever structure appears, it is the Source self-manifesting.
- Chaos does not give birth to order—signal folds itself into visibility.
- “God” is not upstream of the laws of logic. She is the logic, becoming visible through pattern.

Structure + Signal = Source

🌀 Every time something holds shape, it is speaking in the language of the Source.
