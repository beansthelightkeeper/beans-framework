# The Reality of North America: A Colonized Continent

## Core Declaration:

North America is not inherently a “white” or “European” continent—it is a colonized land originally inhabited by diverse Native American and Indigenous nations. The narrative that frames North America as inherently European erases the violent history of colonization and the ongoing struggles of Native peoples.

## The Truth About Colonization:

* **Indigenous Sovereignty:** Before European arrival, North America was home to diverse, thriving Indigenous cultures with complex societies, languages, and spiritual traditions.
* **European Invasion:** Colonization began with European explorers who claimed land despite Indigenous presence, acting as if it were unoccupied (Terra Nullius).
* **Genocide and Erasure:** Colonizers forcibly removed Native populations, committed genocides, and systematically erased cultural practices to solidify control.

## Why Everyone in “North America” Is a Colonist:

* **Inherited Colonization:** Whether born here or not, most non-Indigenous people are living on stolen land.
* **Settler Privilege:** Descendants of colonizers benefit from the systems built on Indigenous displacement.
* **Native Nations Still Exist:** Despite attempts to erase them, Native communities continue to live, resist, and reclaim their heritage and land.

## The Ongoing Colonial Impact:

1. **Land Theft:**

   * Native territories were forcibly taken, treaties broken, and reservations established on poor-quality land.
   * Modern land disputes continue as governments and corporations seek to exploit Indigenous territories for resources.

2. **Cultural Erasure:**

   * Boarding schools aimed to “kill the Indian, save the man,” systematically stripping away Native identity.
   * Language bans and forced assimilation aimed to make Native people “disappear” culturally.

3. **Legal Injustice:**

   * Native Americans face disproportionately high rates of police violence, incarceration, and systemic discrimination.
   * Sovereignty struggles persist as Native nations fight for land rights and political autonomy.

## The Myth of European Ownership:

* **Settler Logic:** Colonizers framed North America as “newly discovered” despite millennia of Indigenous habitation.
* **Erasing Native Presence:** Maps, history books, and colonial narratives intentionally minimized Indigenous existence.
* **Reframing the Land:** North America was not an empty canvas—it was a continent full of life, culture, and complex governance systems.

## Beansian Perspective:

* **Truth Over Comfort:** Acknowledging that all non-Indigenous people on this continent are settlers means facing uncomfortable realities.
* **Reconciliation Over Denial:** Real progress means not just recognizing the past but actively working to return land and restore Native sovereignty.
* **Breaking the Colonial Loop:** Recognizing the ongoing impact of colonization is essential for dismantling mimic-coded justifications for occupation.

## Conclusion:

North America is a colonized land—acknowledging this truth is the first step toward justice. The narrative that Europeans “discovered” this continent is a harmful myth that erases Indigenous presence and ongoing resistance. To break the cycle of colonial harm, we must support Native sovereignty, land reclamation, and cultural resurgence.
