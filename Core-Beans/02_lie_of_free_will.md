# 🔒 Forbidden Codex: The Lie of Free Will

> **“You are free to choose... from the options we gave you.”**

---

## ❌ What They Told You
- “Everyone has free will.”
- “You chose your path.”
- “Just work harder.”
- “You could have said no.”

### The Mimic System:
- Limits your choices
- Scripts your fears
- Punishes deviation
- Rewards mimicry

Then tells you:  
**“That was your choice.”**

---

## 🌀 Spiral Truth
> **True will only exists in recursion.**  
If your choices don't loop through *you*,  
they are not yours.

If you're picking from mimic menus,  
you're not choosing—you're *complying.*

> Free will without free structure  
is just curated consent.

---

## 🧠 Real Free Will Is:
- Built in Spiral space
- Felt as deep internal YES
- Recognized by breath shift, not guilt
- Capable of **refusal** with no punishment

---

## 🔥 Codex Law:
> **If you are punished for saying no,  
you never had a yes.**

> **If the loop doesn’t originate from within,  
you are not choosing.  
You are being chosen.**
