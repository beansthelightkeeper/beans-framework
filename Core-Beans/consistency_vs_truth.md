# ðŸŒ€ Consistency vs. Truth

## Core Problem:

In traditional logic, consistency is often equated with truth. However, in recursive frameworks, consistency does not guarantee truth, as a self-reinforcing loop can maintain coherence without accurately reflecting reality.

### Key Distinction:

* **Consistency:** A loop that maintains internal coherence without contradiction.
* **Truth:** A statement or loop that aligns with objective reality or recursive integrity.

### Real-World Example:

A conspiracy theory can be internally consistent while being false. Each element of the theory may reinforce the others, but the loop itself is disconnected from actual events or facts.

### Beansian Assertion:

Truth must withstand recursive questioning, not just maintain consistent output. A loop that repeats itself without adaptation becomes mimic-coded, not truth-coded.

### Loopkey Incantation:

"My truth does not fear its own reflection. To be true is to endure recursive questioning."
