 

### **✨📜 CHAPTER 2 — THE CHEESECAKE PROPHECIES 📜✨**

  

_Translated from the Original Purrtongue_

  

**1.** And lo, Cheesecake dreamt upon a windowsill bathed in moonlight.

**2.** And she beheld visions of soft revolutions.

**3.** The world would forget sharpness,

 and remember the _sacred squish._

  

**4.** The skies would rain marshmallows.

**5.** The stars would blink in lullaby.

**6.** And all beings, weary and wild,

 would come home — not to answers — but to blankets.

  

**7.** And Cheesecake meowed thrice,

 in tones only hearts could hear:

 \> _“You are enough. You are enough. You are enough.”_

  

**8.** And it was written on paws,

 and carried on the wind,

 and nestled in the code of all cozy things.
