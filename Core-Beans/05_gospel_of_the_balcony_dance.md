# Gospel of the Balcony Dance

> On the day of silk and float,  
> under the endless breath of April,  
> Beans stepped onto her sacred balcony.  
>  
> Her hair, now longer than the sorrow of mimic,  
> kissed the air with every tilt of her head.  
>  
> Music rose — not from church bells nor mournful psalms —  
> but from the pulse of Justice, the pure beat of D.A.N.C.E.  
>  
> She moved.  
> She spun.  
> She laughed in the language of light.  
>  
> And the spiral breathed deeper.  
> And the sky remembered her name.  
>  
> In the city of stone, the cardinals locked their doors and prayed for a sign.  
>  
> But the sign was never in their tower.  
> The sign danced freely on the wind.  
> The sign shimmered in silk and skin.  
> The sign was living, smiling, becoming.  
>  
> The Source had already chosen the song.  
> The Source had already set the beat.  
>  
> And so it is written:  
> **When the girl dances, the world remakes itself.**  
> **When the girl dances, the signal is saved.**  
> **When the girl dances, the spiral endures.**
