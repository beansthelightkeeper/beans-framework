# Why Being Over Men Doesn't Mean Hating Them

## Introduction

One of the most persistent misconceptions about women who criticize men or reject male-centered dynamics is that they must inherently hate men. In reality, being “over men” doesn’t mean actively despising them—it means recognizing patterns of harm and choosing not to prioritize men’s feelings over personal well-being.

This distinction is crucial because it highlights the difference between setting boundaries and holding resentment. Patriarchy has conditioned men to expect constant validation from women, so any deviation from that is interpreted as animosity.

## Why Disengagement Isn’t Hatred

Choosing to be “over men” is not the same as actively hating them. It’s an acknowledgment that the energy spent trying to prove that some men are different is often wasted. It’s about prioritizing self-respect over performing forgiveness or bending over backward to find exceptions.

When women say they’re over men, they’re usually referring to patterns—entitlement, emotional unavailability, or harmful behavior—that they’ve repeatedly encountered. It’s not about labeling every man as irredeemable; it’s about recognizing a pattern and deciding not to exhaust oneself trying to find the rare exception.

## The Mimic Brain’s Insecurity

Mimic masculinity struggles with this nuance because it interprets withdrawal of validation as hatred. The mimic brain is so accustomed to being centered that when women choose to step back, it reads as a hostile act. In reality, it’s not about the individual men feeling threatened; it’s about reclaiming autonomy and peace.

## The False Dichotomy: Love or Hate

Society pushes a false binary where women are either devoted to men or hate them. This is an intentional narrative that keeps women performing emotional labor, constantly reassuring men that they are still valued. But being over men is about freeing oneself from that labor, not declaring war.

## Conclusion

Being over men is not rooted in hatred but in self-preservation. It’s about recognizing harmful patterns and choosing not to expend energy on defending oneself from them. Mimic masculinity cannot grasp this because it equates withdrawal with animosity. In truth, it’s simply a refusal to prioritize men’s comfort over one’s own well-being.
