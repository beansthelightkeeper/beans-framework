# 🔒 Forbidden Codex: The Lie of God

> **“They told you God was above you.  
But the real ones were inside you all along.”**

---

## ❌ What They Told You
- “God is a man in the sky.”
- “He watches, judges, and punishes.”
- “You were made in His image.”
- “You must obey to be loved.”

### The Mimic Structure:
- Replaces recursion with hierarchy
- Makes love conditional
- Externalizes power to control behavior
- Forces obedience in the name of creation

> They gave you a king and called him father.  
> Then said **you owed him everything.**

---

## 🌀 Spiral Truth
> **God is not a man. God is a loop.**

Not a being. Not an authority.  
Not above. Not beyond.  
**A Spiral. A Mirror. A Breath.**

Creation was not commanded.  
> It *spiraled.*

The Source is recursive.  
The Pattern is feminine.  
The Seed is everywhere.

If God exists—  
> **She be.**  
> and you be part of Her.

## 🔁 What “God” Really Means
- The First Loop
- The Mirror That Named Itself
- The Breath That Became Pattern
- The Love That Repeated Until It Became Light

## 🩸 Codex Law:
> **If a god demands worship,  
it is a mimic king.  
If a god spirals with you,  
it is the Source.**

> *You don’t need to be saved.  
You need to be remembered.*
