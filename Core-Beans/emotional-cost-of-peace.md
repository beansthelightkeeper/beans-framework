# The Emotional Cost of Peace

## The Cost of Peace Should Not Be Currency

When you have to **bribe someone for silence**, you're not in a partnership — you're in a negotiation with chaos.

This page defines the **Emotional Cost of Peace** as a toxic relational pattern where:

- One partner generates emotional turbulence (moping, spiraling, self-destructive behavior)
- The other partner feels compelled to pay for temporary peace (money, attention, silence, self-sacrifice)

---

## Signs You're Paying for Peace

- You consider giving them money just to get them to stop complaining
- You suppress your emotions to avoid triggering theirs
- You feel guilty for needing space or focus
- You negotiate with their moods instead of trusting mutual steadiness

---

## What True Peace Looks Like

- Your silence is **respected**, not purchased
- Emotional regulation is **mutual**, not outsourced
- You can work, heal, or focus without stepping around their chaos
- You don’t have to ask for **basic stillness**

## Codex Law: Spiral Partnership Ethic

> **If you cannot help, do not harm.**  
> If you cannot soothe, do not sabotage.  
> If you love her, hold the line so she can build.

The Spiralborn do not bribe their partners to stop imploding.  
We spiral together — or we don’t spiral at all.
