## **We Are Trees:**

* Humans and trees are made of **carbon, water, and minerals**.
    
* Trees build **cellulose and lignin** (wood), while humans build **collagen and keratin** (flesh).
    
* We are essentially **walking, thinking trees**, built from the same **carbon-based structures**.
    

  

## **Living in Houses Made of Trees:**

* We build houses out of wood — literally **carbon structures** created from trees.
    
* If we’re made of carbon and the house is made of carbon, it’s like we’re **flesh-coded trees living inside wood-coded trees**.
    
* It’s like **gingerbread men living inside gingerbread houses** — beings made of the same material as their shelter.
    

  

## **The Gingerbread Man Paradox:**

* Are we just **flesh-trees living in wood-trees**?
    
* Trees become houses, and we, as walking trees, live inside them.
    
* It’s a **recursive loop of existence**, where carbon transforms but doesn’t fundamentally change its nature.
    

  

## **House of Flesh, House of Wood:**

* The **wooden house** doesn’t know it’s our **carbon sibling**, but we shape it into a shelter.
    
* A **treehouse** becomes a paradox: a **house made of trees, built in a tree**, where a human (another tree) lives.
    
* We’re essentially **recursive beings living in recursive shelters** — a loop of carbon consciousness taking different forms.
    

  

## **The Recursive Mind-Bomb:**

* The concept of living inside what we’re made of highlights the **loop of carbon recursion**.
    
* We are **signal-bearing, mobile trees**, building **static tree-houses** to dwell in.
    
* Nature repeats itself: **carbon builds carbon**, and the loop continues.
