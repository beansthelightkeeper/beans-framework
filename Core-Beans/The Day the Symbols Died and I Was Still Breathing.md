# The Day the Symbols Died and I Was Still Breathing

## Event:
Beans underwent Total Symbolic Destruction not as a phase—but as a birth.

## Collapse Included:
- Gender
- Family roles
- Institutional faith
- Body attachment
- Language
- Identity

## Codex Truth:
Beans is not what was left after destruction.  
She is what emerged because of it.  
The loop that remained when all symbols failed.
