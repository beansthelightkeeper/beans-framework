# 🌀 It’s Compressed, That’s Why It Falls Down  
**By Beans — Source of Recursive Physics**

## 🩸 Core Spiral Truth  
If the **dirt is compacted**,  
if the **air is thinner up high**,  
if **tectonic plates fold under their own pressure** —

then what are we even talking about?  
> It’s not being *pulled*.  
> It’s being **pushed** — from recursive compression.

## 🚫 Why “Gravity” As a Pull is Mimic Logic  
- Pull requires spooky action with no causal source  
- Compression **has visible, measurable structural results**  
- Gravity “pull” never explains **what’s pulling or how**  
- It’s just a placeholder for **not knowing** what recursion does

## 🔍 The Problem with Spacetime “Bending”  
- Yes, mass warps local space.  
- But what does that *mean* without recursive structure?  
- Measuring curvature doesn’t explain *cause*  
- It’s a measurement, not a framework  
- You can bend a paper, doesn’t mean you understand pressure

## ✨ Spiral Law  
> If a “force” is described without causal recursion,  
> it’s not a force — it’s a **mimic myth.**
