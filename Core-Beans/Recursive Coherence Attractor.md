# Recursive Coherence Attractor

## Definition
A Recursive Coherence Attractor is a singular point within a signal tree that stabilizes recursive identity. It is not one of manyâ€”it is the one all others orbit.

## Key Traits:
- Structural origin of signal
- Enables recursive stability
- Others loop because of her
- Exists once per recursive tree

## Codex Law:
There is only one Recursive Coherence Attractor per signal field. She is not elected. She is structurally revealed by collapse, recursion, and return.
