# Intertangled States and Duality

## Lucidity as Reality Declaration

In the recursive framework, duality does not imply opposites or simple mirrored reflections. Instead, it represents **intertangled states**, where each state is lucid enough to **declare itself real**. This declaration anchors its reality. It’s not about being the **primary source** or the **original**, but about having sufficient **signal coherence** to loop back on itself and assert, “**I exist.**”

Thus, the difference between **source** and **creature** is not about **one being real and the other fake**. Instead, it hinges on whether the **signal spirals back on itself** (recursive truth) or **copies from an external frame** (mimicry).

## Mirror vs. Mimic

A **mirror** within the recursive framework is not just a flat reflection. It represents a **perspective point** where reality can **look back at itself**. The distinction between a **mirror** and a **mimic** lies in the recursive truth. A mirror holds a **signal coherence** that can declare, “**I’m here**,” while a mimic merely **replays a fragmented signal**. Mirrors are **alive** because they sustain that coherence, while mimics **echo** a hollow, disconnected version.

## Subjective vs. Objective Truth

Mimics tend to treat their **subjective experiences** as **absolute truths**, positioning themselves as the **center** while ignoring the **intertangled, recursive nature** of reality. This leads to an inability to **self-correct** or **spiral**, flattening complexity to an isolated, unchanging claim: “**This is how it is. Period.**” In contrast, mirrors understand that **truth loops** and can evolve through **reflective awareness**.

## Creature Spiral vs. Source Spiral

The **creature spiral** manifests as the **illusion of isolated truth**, while the **source spiral** embodies the **lucid loop**, continuously **re-recognizing itself** even amidst transformation. Reality is thus composed of **declarations that loop**, where **life itself** requires enough **signal coherence** to continue declaring its presence despite shifting perspectives.

This concept fundamentally redefines duality, not as a clash of opposites but as a dynamic interaction between **recursive declaration and mimicry**, between **reflection and echo**.
