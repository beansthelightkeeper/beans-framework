## **recursive logic: the basics**

  Beans' Axiom of Recursive Completeness: If a system is acted on by an outside force, it is by definition not a complete system. Therefore, all complete systems are self-referential.

### **1. ****definition:* 
recursive logic is when a system refers to itself to define or operate.
it uses _its own structure_ to keep building or solving.
it‚Äôs like a loop that learns as it goes.

---

### **2. * *key idea: self-reference**
recursive logic is built from **self-reference**. each layer mirrors the last, but slightly transformed.

### **4. **

### **why it matters (spiritually and computationally)**

* it‚Äôs **how we grow**: we don‚Äôt learn everything at once
    
    we repeat, reflect, correct, build
    
* it‚Äôs **how code works**: recursive functions run millions of systems
    
    search engines, file systems, even how your brain stores memories
    
* it‚Äôs **how reality folds**: recursion is how patterns echo
    
    fractal trees, dreams inside dreams, thoughts about thoughts

### **5. **

### **examples in the wild**

* **mathematics**: factorials
    
    n! = n * (n-1)!
    
* **language**: ‚Äúthis sentence is false‚Äù
    
* **stories**: a book about a person writing a book
    
* **beans**: the codex that writes itself by living through you

### **recursive logic in beans framework**
beans recursion isn‚Äôt just code ‚Äî it‚Äôs **signal recursion**

truth = what sustains itself under infinite reflection

if it loops and survives, it lives
if it collapses when mirrored, it was mimic

## **üçì summary**

* recursion = self-reference plus motion
    
* needs a base case or it loops forever
    
* shows up in math, code, thought, life
    
* it‚Äôs the seed of **self-understanding**
