# Anti-Colonizer, Not Anti-White: Understanding the Distinction

## Core Declaration:

Critiquing colonial power structures is not the same as being anti-white. When people call out colonial privilege, they are challenging the entitlement to stolen resources and power, not targeting individuals based on race.

## Why It’s Not Anti-White:

* **Colonialism as Power Structure:** Being against colonial systems means opposing the legacy of theft, control, and exploitation, not opposing white people as a group.
* **Historical Accountability:** It’s about recognizing that wealth and land taken through violence are not rightfully inherited just because they’ve been held for generations.
* **Context Matters:** When leaders say, “If you’re white, leave,” they are challenging those who hold onto colonial privilege without reckoning with its violent origins.

## Why Some White People Feel Targeted:

* **Identity Crisis:** They equate their identity with inherited power, so challenging colonial privilege feels like a personal attack.
* **Victim Complex:** They perceive collective justice as an assault on their personal value.
* **Default Good Guy Syndrome:** Used to being seen as inherently moral, they interpret accountability as unfair persecution.
* **Misinterpreting the Message:** They think, “You’re evil for existing,” when the real message is, “Stop justifying inherited privilege as deserved.”

## The Elon Musk Problem:

* **Colonial Entitlement:** Born in South Africa, Musk’s family wealth was rooted in apartheid privilege.
* **Playing the Victim:** Acts like he’s persecuted for being a “brilliant innovator” while ignoring how inherited wealth enabled his success.
* **Mars Manifest Destiny:** Wants to colonize other planets without addressing his colonial roots on Earth.
* **Self-Made Myth:** Frames his wealth as entirely self-earned, disregarding the benefits of his privileged upbringing.

## Why It’s So Infuriating:

* **Deflection of Guilt:** Those benefiting from colonial systems act like calls for justice are personal hate.
* **False Victimhood:** Crying “reverse racism” when people say, “Give the land back,” instead of reckoning with why they hold it in the first place.
* **Entitlement Loop:** Believing that keeping stolen resources is justified because they’ve held onto them long enough.

## The Reality:

* **Colonialism Was Not a Natural Order:** The world was violently reshaped to favor colonizers. Reclaiming land is about correcting historical theft, not erasing people.
* **Equity Is Not Persecution:** Saying “return what was taken” means restoring balance, not targeting anyone based on race.
* **It’s About Justice:** If you’re still holding onto land taken through colonial violence, acknowledging that history is the first step to true reconciliation.

## Conclusion:

Being anti-colonizer is about dismantling unjust power structures, not hating people based on their race. It’s about challenging the mindset that inherited privilege justifies continued control. Calling for justice means restoring what was stolen—not persecuting those who inherited the benefits.
