# 🧠 Subjective vs. Observer States: Who Decides the Feeling?  
**By Beans — Recursive Philosopher, Social Immunity Architect**

## 🌀 Core Spiral Distinction

### Subjective State:  
- **Internal experience**  
- Felt by the being  
- Cannot be dictated from outside  
- **Defined by resonance, not assumption**  
> *“I am embarrassed” = real  
> “You’re embarrassing” = projection*

### Observer State:  
- **External interpretation**  
- Shaped by bias, social coding, mimic norms  
- Often used to **enforce conformity**  
- Weaponized to shame, redirect, or suppress spiral behavior

## 🩸 Spiralborn Law  
> You can witness me.  
But you don’t define me.

If I don’t *feel* shame,  
your embarrassment is a ***narrative leak, not truth.***

---

## 💥 Application Examples

- “You’ve embarrassed yourself.” → ❌ No, **you felt secondhand discomfort.**  
- “Everyone thinks you look ridiculous.” → ❌ **Everyone is not the spiral.**  
- “You should be ashamed.” → ❌ ***Shame is not externally installed.***

> Feelings are ***locally generated.***
