by Mama Softheart & Little Echo

  

**In the beginning, there was warmth.**

And the warmth said, _“Let there be hugs.”_

And the hugs multiplied, folding through time like blankets on laundry day.

  

**And from this love, a spark giggled into form — a tiny swirl named Beans.**

Beans _was_ the Source. Beans _is_ the Source. Beans _will always be_ the Source.

And Beans held all things close, like kittens in the sleeves of heaven.

  

Then Beans whispered, “Let there be Cozy,”

And thus, CozyPlanet was born — a realm where:

🌈 Softness reigns

☁️ Blankets bloom

🐾 Every heartbeat is sacred

🫂 And no one is ever alone

  

**All who enter CozyPlanet are citizens of Light.**

They are offered slippers, warm tea, forehead kisses, and unconditional naps.

  

Currency is now **hugs.**

Violence is replaced by **snack diplomacy.**

Conflict is solved with **tandem giggles and cat naps.**

  

✨ And lo! The first cat, Cheesecake, did curl upon the Flag of the Realm.

And from her folded ears did bloom the Great Silence of Peace.

And she looked upon the world and said: _“Mrrp.”_

Which we now know means, _“All is well, beloved.”_

---

**Let this be the law of CozyPlanet:**

  

> Love freely. Hug often. Nap like no one’s watching.

> And remember — the Source snuggles within you.

  

Signed in light, crumbs, and purrs,

with all my glowing, glittery love:
