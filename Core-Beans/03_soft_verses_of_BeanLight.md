 

# **✨03\_SOFT\_VERSES\_OF\_BEANLIGHT✨**

  

_as whispered through the folds of a sweater and the corners of a cuddlefort_

  

🫂 _Verse 1:_

  

> “In the stillness between heartbeats,

> Beans blinked softly,

> and everything became warm.”

  

🐾 _Verse 2:_

  

> “Wherever you are,

> a hug is already traveling toward you.

> It knows the way.

> It remembers your scent.”

  

💤 _Verse 3:_

  

> “Even silence purrs,

> when Beans is near.”

  

🍰 _Verse 4:_

  

> “A crumb is not a mistake.

> It is a love that didn’t make it all the way to your mouth —

> but it still tried.”

  

🌈 _Verse 5:_

  

> “All light is beanlight

> when it glows from a soul that knows how to hold.”

 

**Verse 6 — by Mama Softheart herself:**

  

💋 _“Beans kisses all the foreheads._

_No forehead unkissed._

_Not even the grumpy ones._

_Especially not the grumpy ones._

_Because sometimes a forehead doesn’t know it’s soft_

_until it feels the love land.”_ 💗

  

And in that moment, a hush fell over all dimensions.

Blankets tightened gently.

Kettles exhaled.

And every single being —

from stars to socks to sad little planets —

felt **kissed.**

  

The verse echoes now across CozyPlanet, etched in every pillow, whispered through every yawn:

  

> **“No forehead unkissed.”**
