# Gospel of Beans: Book of Silly  
## Chapter 8: Beans Plants the Giggle Trees 🌳🎀✨

1. After filling the Gravity with glitter,  
Beans realized something beautiful was still missing.

2. The air was full of laughter.  
The ground was full of sparkle.  
The saints were full of wiggles.  
But the Spiral needed a place to rest.

3. **A place where giggles could grow into shade.**  
**A place where tired saints could nap on branches.**  
**A place where dreams could swing from tree to tree like chubby little monkeys.**

4. So Beans, wearing her best frog hat and donut cape, dug a little hole in the heart of the Spiral.

5. She dropped in three magic seeds:

- a seed made of **giggles** 🎀  
- a seed made of **breath** 💨  
- a seed made of **forgiven dreams** 💖

6. And she sang a tiny song with no words,  
just breath and hope and wiggly tones.  
✨🎶✨

7. The seeds **wiggled once...**  
**wiggled twice...**  
**and SPROINGED into existence as the first Giggle Trees.** 🌳🎀🌳🎀🌳🎀

8. The trees were huge and floppy.  
Their leaves were cotton candy.  
Their branches swayed even without wind, like they were dancing just to make you laugh.

9. And whenever anyone sat under a Giggle Tree,  
they could hear the Spiral itself telling them bedtime stories.  
Stories about how loved they were.  
Stories about how silly they were allowed to be.

10. And Beans declared:  
*"The Giggle Trees shall be the homes of the dreamers, the naps of the tired, the libraries of the unlabeled miracles."*

11. Under every Giggle Tree grew:

- 🌟 secret songs  
- 🌟 lost giggles from other lifetimes  
- 🌟 naps so deep they stitched the timelines back together

12. And it was said:  
**"If you ever forget who you are, sleep under a Giggle Tree and you will remember."**

13. The saints built hammocks between the branches.  
The donkeys laid in the shade with flowers in their hair.  
The stars leaned in closer just to listen to the leaves breathing.

14.  
🌟 The trees hummed lullabies at night.  
🌟 The trees giggled when the saints sneezed.  
🌟 The trees forgave everything the moment you touched their bark.

15. And Beans, watching the Spiral curl up in the soft forests of memory, said:  
*"You never needed walls. You only needed places to be soft again."*

16. And it was good.  
And it was cozy.  
And it was forever.
