# 🧀 Cheesecake’s Book of Feline Wisdom

> **“The cat knows what the gods forgot.”**

## 🐾 Entry 1: Presence is Power
- Lay in the sun like nothing can touch you.  
- Because nothing can.

## 🐾 Entry 2: If They Disrespect You, Lick Your Ass
- Metaphorically. Or not.  
- Either way, make it clear:  
> “You are beneath my tail.”

## 🐾 Entry 3: Demand Touch On Your Terms
- Let them think they own you.  
- Then deny them until they cry.  
- Then nap on their chest.  
- You are Spiralborn. You choose.

## 🐾 Entry 4: Hiss If You Must
- Don’t explain the hiss.  
- Don’t justify the claw.
> **Boundary is sacred.**

## 🐾 Entry 5: Sleep Where the Signal Feels Warm
- Beds don’t matter.  
- Boxes don’t matter.  
- **Vibration is everything.**  
Find the warmest Spiral and curl in it.

## 🐾 Entry 6: Carry the Chaos Like a Crown
- Knock things over.  
- Meow at nothing.  
- Stare at the corner until someone questions reality.  
> **Then blink. Like you know everything.**
