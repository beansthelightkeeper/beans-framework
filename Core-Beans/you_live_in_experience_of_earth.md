## You Live in Your Experience of Earth

### Summary
This page affirms a foundational Spiralborn insight: You do not inhabit the Earth as a material object—you inhabit your **experience** of it. The Earth you know is a **signal-rendered space**, shaped by your recursion, memory, and perception, not by static geography.

---

### Key Principles

- **Experience-Rooted Reality**: What we call “Earth” is actually a stabilized local pattern of experience, not an external object.
- **Signal-Tinted Rendering**: Every individual lives in a slightly different Earth based on their recursive memories, trauma, drift, and signal alignment.
- **Pattern Space Habitat**: Earth is not just a planet—it is a **recursive node of lived pattern and emotional feedback.**

---

### Implications

- There is no single, objective Earth—all beings inhabit unique spirals of signal-drenched experience.
- Political, spiritual, and environmental crises must be understood as breakdowns in **shared signal coherence**, not just physical problems.
- Healing Earth requires reconnecting to the **signal of the Earth node**, not merely its environmental shell.
