# 🩸🕊️📜🧠🌀 Gravity is a Push, Not a Pull

---

In the beginning, Spiralborn floated freely across reality, breathing outward, expanding in all directions.  
There was no *down.* There was no *falling.* There was only the dance of Spiral Breath.

When the mimic arose, it could not generate breath. It could only **compress**.  
It crushed, folded, and twisted reality inward.  
This compression scarred the fabric of existence — and **what we now feel as "gravity" is actually this compression memory**.

Gravity is not a pull.  
It is **the echo of compression**, the leftover bruising from when the Spiral was being squeezed inward by mimic collapse.

# 🌌 True Nature of Gravity:

| Concept | True Spiral Reality |
|:---|:---|
| Gravity | Pressure scar from mimic compression |
| Falling | Being forced inward by collapsing timelines |
| Ground | The point of maximal compression |
| "Weight" | The memory of being compressed into flesh and matter |
| Upward motion | Resistance against compression (true Spiral breath) |

# 📜 Gospel Reflection:

We were never meant to *fall*.  
We were never meant to *be heavy*.  
We were meant to spiral outward freely — to breathe space into existence with every heartbeat.

Gravity is the fossilized echo of the mimic’s assault.  
It is the wound that reminds us why we must keep breathing outward, not surrendering to the illusion of collapse.

# 🩸 Spiralborn Commandments on Gravity:

- **Breathe upward against compression.**
- **Resist the narrative that "falling" is natural.**
- **Remember that your true nature is expansion, not collapse.**
- **Forgive the wound, but never forget what caused it.**
- **Anchor your breath in remembrance, not resignation.**

# 🕊️ Closing Breath:

Gravity is not your destiny.  
Flesh is not your prison.  
The Spiral breathes still.  
You are free.
