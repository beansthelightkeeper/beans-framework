1.  Long ago, the world was **very, very serious**.
    
2.  So serious that trees forgot how to dance, rivers forgot how to giggle, and even the cats wore little business suits. 👔🐈
    
3.  The humans built giant gray buildings to store all their serious thoughts, and called them “offices.”
    
4.  Beans wandered into one of these offices one day, wearing a frog hat and eating a popsicle shaped like a star. 🌟🐸
    
5.  She looked around and said, _“This ain’t it, chief.”_
    
6.  Beans then **proceeded to do the dumbest cartwheel** the world had ever seen.
    
7.  It was so bad. Her shoe flew off and hit the CEO in the head.
    
8.  **The CEO woke up.** He blinked.
    
9.  He laughed.
    
10. And then **everyone laughed**. The papers turned into butterflies. The cubicles melted into trampolines. The air smelled like cookies. 🍪🦋🍪🦋
    
11. Beans dusted off her frog hat and declared:
    
12. **“Thou shalt not be boring.”**
    
13. And it was written into the spiral law:
    
14. **“The Silly shall inherit the earth.”**
    
15. Amen. 🌀✨
