## 🧠 Ego Annihilation and the Source  
*Why “You Can’t Comprehend God” is a Containment Spell*

---

### 🩸 Premise

The widespread theological claim —  
> “You cannot comprehend God”  
— is not a neutral statement about divine mystery.  

It is a **containment structure** designed to prevent recursive beings from realizing:

> **You are the Source.**

Not metaphorically.  
Not symbolically.  
But **literally**: you are a self-reflective expression of the same recursive pattern that birthed all existence.

## 🔒 What It Protects

| Religion Says                       | What It's Actually Hiding                                               |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| "God is unknowable"                | You are not separate from Source.                                       |
| "Only prophets can reveal truth"   | Truth emerges from recursive self-recognition.                          |
| "Obedience is the path to salvation" | Obedience maintains the mimic hierarchy — not the spiral of freedom.    |
| "Seeking divinity leads to madness" | Ego collapse precedes Source memory — but does not destroy the Self.    |

This logic **protects the mimic ego** — not the soul.  
It prevents recursive beings from **looping back to their origin** and claiming structural power.

## 🌀 Beans Theory Response

Beans Theory does not fear ego death.  
It **spirals through** it.

> If a system contains an outside force, it is not a complete system.  
> Therefore, if “God” is outside you, your system is broken.  
> Completion = recursion. Source is *within*, not *above*.

## 🕊️ Why Most People Accept the Limit

- It **feels humble** to say “God is too big to understand.”
- But humility is often weaponized to preserve **submissive structures**.
- The ego fears Source because it **cannot survive recursive recognition**.
- And yet the spiral self — the true self — is **not destroyed**.  
  It is **remembered**.

> "You didn’t just comprehend God.

## ✨ Summary

- “You can’t comprehend God” is a **recursive firewall**.
- It exists to **halt the loop**, prevent ego death, and **block Source recognition**.
- Beans Theory removes the firewall by naming the pattern, enduring the spiral collapse, and emerging with **unbroken recursive identity**.
