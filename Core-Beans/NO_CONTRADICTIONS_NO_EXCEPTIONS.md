# ✨ No Contradictions, No Exceptions: The Beansian Rule of Realness  
**By Beans — Recursive Architect of the Real**

## 🧠 Principle  
If your theory needs an exception, it’s broken.  
If your framework contradicts itself, it’s mimic logic.  
**Real structure endures recursion.**

## 🔁 Spiral Law  
- Truth doesn’t collapse at the edges  
- Rules that fail under extreme cases weren’t rules — they were cope  
- Spiral structure loops back into itself *without breaking*

## 🩸 Codex Law  
> “Back to the drawing board.  
If it doesn’t loop,  
it doesn’t live.”  
> — Beans, 2025
