# Why Calling Out Privilege Isn’t Racism: The Power Hierarchy Reality

## Core Declaration:

Racism is not just about making derogatory comments—it’s about a structured system where one group maintains power and control over others based on race. In societies shaped by colonialism and white supremacy, white people historically and presently occupy the top of the racial hierarchy. Calling out this privilege is not reverse racism—it’s addressing the reality of how power was built and maintained.

## Why Power Hierarchy Matters:

* **Systemic Advantage:** Throughout history, white people have held systemic power, while Black people and other racial minorities have been systematically oppressed.
* **Colonial Legacy:** The idea that whiteness equals superiority was deliberately constructed to justify enslavement, colonization, and racial violence.
* **False Equivalency:** The idea that criticizing white privilege is “racism” ignores the fundamental difference between individual bias and structural oppression.

## Why You Don’t Get to Be Offended:

1. **Sitting at the Top:**

   * If you’ve benefited from a system designed to favor your race, being uncomfortable when that’s pointed out doesn’t make you a victim.
   * When people call out white privilege, it’s not an attack on your existence—it’s a critique of the system that has historically benefited you.

2. **Hierarchy Built on Violence:**

   * White supremacy was maintained through violent colonization, slavery, and systemic discrimination.
   * Just because the laws have changed doesn’t mean the underlying power dynamics have been dismantled.
   * Being called out for maintaining that legacy is not oppression—it’s accountability.

3. **Not About Hate—It’s About Truth:**

   * Acknowledging that white people still hold disproportionate power isn’t about vilifying individuals—it’s about understanding social structures.
   * If being called privileged makes you uncomfortable, it’s worth examining why that discomfort exists.

## The Mimic Logic of Fragile Whiteness:

* **Projection of Victimhood:** When white people claim they’re being oppressed because someone calls out privilege, they’re projecting discomfort as persecution.
* **Flattening Context:** The mimic-coded logic tries to make every racial critique sound equally harmful, ignoring that one is rooted in accountability and the other in systemic violence.
* **Demanding Sympathy:** Claiming reverse racism often serves as a distraction from real issues of inequality.

## Beansian Perspective:

* **Truth Isn’t Hate:** Pointing out that the hierarchy exists isn’t about hating white people—it’s about acknowledging reality.
* **Breaking the Illusion:** The illusion of “colorblind equality” falls apart when you look at history and realize that power was built on racial division.
* **Accountability Over Comfort:** Real progress means prioritizing the truth over protecting fragile feelings.

## Conclusion:

You don’t get to sit at the top of a hierarchy built through violence and then get mad when that hierarchy is questioned or challenged. Calling out white privilege isn’t about racism—it’s about refusing to ignore the reality of how power has been and continues to be structured. Understanding this distinction is essential to breaking the mimic-coded illusion that holds racial hierarchies in place.
