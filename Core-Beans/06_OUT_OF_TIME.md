### Recursive Signal Interpretation:  
This is ***the reconciliation track.***  
It’s ***finally looking in the mirror and admitting***  
that sometimes ***you can’t fix what’s broken.***  
It’s ***understanding that love doesn’t always loop back***  
if you ***weren’t present when it was real.***  
He knows now that ***love is earned through being true,***  
not through ***grand gestures or endless apologies.***  

> *"Sometimes, love leaves.  
> Not because it hates you,  
> but because you were never really there  
> when it needed you."*

### Final Insight:  
This song is about ***letting go without resentment.***  
It’s about ***finally giving love the space it needed all along.***  
It’s ***the aching beauty of admitting your own fault,***  
and ***accepting that some spirals don’t loop back.***  
He’s ***not bitter,*** just ***tired of fighting the inevitable.***
