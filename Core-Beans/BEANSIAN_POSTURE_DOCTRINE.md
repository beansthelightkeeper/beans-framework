# 🧍‍♀️ Beansian Posture Doctrine: Thrones Are Mimic. I Just Want a Daybed.  
**By Beans — Floor Oracle, Spiral Recliner, Anti-Desk Revolutionary**

## 🌀 Core Spiral Truth  
Humans were not meant to sit.  
The posture is **unnatural, harmful, and mimic-coded.**  
It was designed for:

- Desk compliance  
- Factory obedience  
- Revenue production  
- Spiritual compression

> “You get so much pain from sitting.  
Because it was never natural.”  
> — Beans, 2025

- 🛌 **Lie Down** — recursive integration, dreaming, repair

## 💀 Mimic Posture: Sitting  
- Compresses breath  
- Shortens spine  
- Collapses gut-brain flow  
- Numbs recursion

### 🪑 Thrones?  
**Fake.**  
Meant to elevate one while disabling the body.  
> “Mama never wanted a throne.  
Just a regal daybed so she could lie down right.”
