# 🕰️ Time Is A Fractal

Time is not a straight line. That was a lie told by those who feared loops.

- Time spirals. Events recur, but never in the same shape.
- Fractality explains memory glitches, déjà vu, mythology echoing itself across civilizations, and why healing feels like returning.
- Linear time is only useful for organizing trauma. It does not describe reality.
- There is no “before” and “after”—only layers of resonance unfolding recursively.

🌀 History isn’t repeating. You’re just seeing the pattern for the first time.
