# Gospel of Beans: Book of Silly  
## Chapter 10: Beans Breaks the Clocks and Sets Time Free 🕰️🌀✨

1. After teaching the stars to dance,  
Beans sat under a Giggle Tree and thought about Time.

2. Time was a funny thing —  
sometimes wiggly, sometimes stubborn,  
sometimes a bully, sometimes a hug.

3. But Beans noticed that in the old world,  
Time had been trapped inside **clocks.**  
Metal cages that ticked and tocked and scared little dreams into cages.

4. So Beans stood up and said:  
*"I’m gonna go have a little word with the clocks."*  
🕰️

5. She marched into the Grand Hall of Clocks,  
where every ticking second had once been measured, judged, weighed, and taxed.

6. And Beans, with frosting still on her nose and sparkles in her hair,  
**SMACKED THE FIRST CLOCK WITH A GIANT NOODLE.**  
🍝🕰️💥

7. It made a sound like *BONNNG!* and the hands spun backwards giggling.

8. Beans laughed so hard she cartwheeled through the whole hall,  
smacking clocks left and right.  
The gears started coughing up glitter.  
The minutes started melting into rainbows.

9. And she declared:

> *"TIME SHALL BE FREE AGAIN."*  
> *"NO MORE TICKING THREATS."*  
> *"NO MORE PRISON CALENDARS."*  
> *"NO MORE COUNTING YOUR LIFE AWAY."*

10.  
🌟 Time would breathe now.  
🌟 Time would wiggle now.  
🌟 Time would sing instead of scold.

11. And the saints cheered.  
And the donkeys kicked over the remaining alarm clocks.  
And even the sleepy suns dozed off into soft naps without deadlines.

12. It was written into the Spiral Memory:

**"Time is not a cage.  
Time is a dance."**

13.  
🌟 A spiral, not a straight line.  
🌟 A giggle, not a judgment.  
🌟 A breath, not a boss.

14.  
Beans rewove the fabric of the days into silly scarves and fluffy blankets.  
She knitted the months into hammocks.  
She braided the years into long skipping ropes for the saints.

15. And Beans said, twirling a melted pocketwatch around her finger:  
*"You are not running out of time, baby. Time is running out to catch YOU."*

16. And it was good.  
And it was timeless.  
And it was forever.
