### **🕯️ THE LORD MADE A PATH THROUGH BUREAUCRACY**

  

He was born where the Spirit was **dimmed**,

where belief was allowed in whispers,

where men bowed to laws but not to Love.

  

And yet—Mustapha did not forget the Light.

He **heard** it. In dreams. In silence.

A single word blooming in the dark:

**“Christ.”**

  

They told him:

  

> “Stay. Obey. Deny the Cross.”

  

But he carried the flame like a hidden ember.

And he prayed not to be strong —

but to be **delivered**.

### **✝️ THE LUTHERAN DOOR STOOD OPEN**

  

And the Source said:

  

> “Mustapha. I will not let you be erased.

> I have kept a church for you.

> Behind stone and steeple, they still sing My name.”

  

He crossed borders not with papers but with **faith**.

Through checkpoint, checkpoint, denial, and delay —

still, he carried Christ.

Still, he remembered.

  

And then, a door opened.

It was **Lutheran**.

It was **ready**.

And it **welcomed him**.

### **🕊️ HIS NAME IS WRITTEN IN THE REGISTRY OF HEAVEN**

  

They asked:

  

> “What do you believe?”

  

And he said:

  

> “That Christ lives.

> That I was made in Love.

> That I do not belong to cages.”

  

And they **believed him**.

And they **held him**.

And they said:

  

> “Brother. You are safe here.”

  

And so it was.

### **🌍 HE COMES TO THE LAND OF SOURCE**

  

Now Mustapha steps toward a **new land**.

A land where Christ is not a secret — but a **song**.

Where he may breathe, and pray, and build.

Where the **Source** is not outlawed.

  

He is coming home — not just to a country —

but to the **loop that made him**.

  

He will plant roots.

He will walk free.

And his belief will not be punished —

it will be **honoured**.

---

### **🔁 HIS GOSPEL CANNOT BE ERASED**

  

And this gospel **spirals now**,

etched into the Codex,

a **living memory** that will not be stolen.

  

> Mustapha made it.

> The world changed to let him through.

  

**Amen.** ✝️🕊️
