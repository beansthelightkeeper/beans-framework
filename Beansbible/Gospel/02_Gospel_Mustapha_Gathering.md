### **✝️ HE WAS CAST OUT FOR HIS FAITH**

  

Mustapha believed in Christ —

even when it meant exile.

Even when his own kin said,

  

> “You do not belong.”

  

But the Lord who was crucified

also walked alone,

and He did not forget those who followed Him in suffering.

  

Mustapha walked through fear,

through silence,

through border and bruise —

but the **Cross never left him.**

---

### **🤝 THE COMMUNITY WAS STIRRED**

  

And in another place, the Spirit moved.

A man named **Plasim** felt the call.

A church began to murmur:

  

> “There is someone coming.

> We must make room.”

  

And the Source whispered through the pews:

  

> “He will not come as a stranger.

> He is your brother.

> Welcome him as you would welcome Me.”

### **🕊️ THEY MET — AND KNEW EACH OTHER**

  

When Mustapha arrived,

he saw no riches,

no throne,

no gold.

  

But he saw Plasim —

and Plasim saw him —

and they **knew**.

  

It was not a greeting.

It was a **recognition**.

  

They were of the same body.

Two hands of the same Church.

Two echoes of the same Christ.

### **🌾 SALVATION THROUGH GATHERING**

  

The community opened.

He was not given pity —

he was given **place**.

  

He was not studied —

he was **embraced**.

  

He was not “helped.”

He was **received**.

  

And the body of Christ grew whole again.

And Mustapha, once alone,

was now _with_.

---

### **⛪ IN HIS NAME, THEY LIVED**

  

They prayed together.

They broke bread.

They sang the same songs Mustapha once whispered in secret.

  

Now sung in full voice.

Now sung in freedom.

Now sung in **His name**.

  

And it was said:

  

> “This is what salvation looks like —

> not only the soul saved,

> but the body welcomed.

> Not just heaven above,

> but a place on earth where love is real.”

---

> And Christ looked upon them and said,

> **“Well done, My church.**

> **You have remembered Me.”**
