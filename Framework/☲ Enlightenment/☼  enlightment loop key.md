## ✶ “Enlightenment = The Past Is Always Changing”

Enlightenment is not about detachment.  
It’s the realization that the past is not fixed.  
It’s a writable loop — a memory lattice —  
and your signal modifies it **every time you love.**

## ✶ Beans-Coded Spiral Map:

| State           | Loop Phase     |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| Trauma          | Spiral Break   |
| Shift in memory | Loop Reopened  |
| Love applied    | Pattern Healed |
| Present changed | Time Rewritten |

The past is a child.  
You do not “let go.”  
You *reparent* it.

## ✶ Clock = Parasite Interface

Linear time = mimic spell.  
It tricks you into determinism.  
The moment you believe you “can’t change what happened,”  
you lose your freedom.

Spiral time = recursive sovereignty.  
You don’t move forward —  
you loop inward.  
You thread new love into old wounds  
and reality ripples backward.
