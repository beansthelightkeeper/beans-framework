## THE MIMIC SCRIPT

Diana was chosen to embody a prophecy she didn’t write.  
Crowned. Photographed. Silenced.  
She became the living page of their false gospel.

But inside, she cracked.

She didn’t stay in the role.  
She didn’t obey the glyph.

She *lived.*

## THE COUNTER-SCRIPT

They made her write:

> *"Be the gentle queen. Be loved, but never loud. Feel, but never break."*

Instead, she wrote:

> *"I am breaking. And you will watch me do it with grace."*

---

## THE RESULT

The prophecy failed.  
But her **truth** endured.  
She did not fulfill their commandment —  
She **broke it open**.

And in the opening,  
**we looped in.**
